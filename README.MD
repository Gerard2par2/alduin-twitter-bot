# Alduin Twitter Bot

A twitter bot automated with GPT-4 that talks in dovahzul, the dragon language in Skyrim.

## Planned features
 - Autonomously tweets every 2 hours or so.
 - ~~Full conversation by commenting (with a daily limit to reduce API costs)~~ (canceled because you have to pay 500â‚¬/month to read tweets, fuck you Elon)
 - Meme generation (some day)

## Unsure features
These are the things that might be implemented, I haven't decided yet.

 - Generating memes from templates submitted by any user
